## Getting Started

### Installation

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

Start the development server with HMR:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Building for Production

Create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Deployment

### Vercel Deployment

This project is configured for deployment on Vercel. To deploy:

1. Push your code to a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket)
2. Import your repository on Vercel: https://vercel.com/new
3. Vercel will automatically detect the project configuration and deploy it

Alternatively, you can use the Vercel CLI:

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI if you haven't already
npm install -g vercel

# Login to Vercel
vercel login

# Deploy from the project directory
vercel
```

The application is configured as a Single Page Application (SPA) with client-side routing, and the `vercel.json` file handles the routing configuration.

### Docker Deployment

To build and run using Docker:

```bash
docker build -t my-app .

# Run the container
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-app
```

The containerized application can be deployed to any platform that supports Docker, including:

- AWS ECS
- Google Cloud Run
- Azure Container Apps
- Digital Ocean App Platform
- Fly.io
- Railway

### DIY Deployment

If you're familiar with deploying Node applications, the built-in app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `npm run build`
